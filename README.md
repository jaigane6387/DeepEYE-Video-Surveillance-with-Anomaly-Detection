# DeepEYE: Anomaly Detection in Video Surveillance

Welcome to the DeepEYE: Anomaly Detection in Video Surveillance project repository! This repository contains tools and resources for detecting anomalies in video surveillance footage. Whether you're a data scientist, a machine learning enthusiast, or a developer, this project aims to provide you with a comprehensive solution for anomaly detection in video data.

## Project Structure

### Data
- **Train_data**: This directory contains training data for building anomaly detection models.
- **Test_Data**: This directory contains test data for evaluating the performance of the anomaly detection models.

### Code
- **utils.py**: This Python script contains utility functions used across the project.
- **model.py**: This script implements the anomaly detection model.
- **test.py**: This script tests the anomaly detection model.
- **training.npy**: Numpy file containing preprocessed training data.
- **model.h5**: Trained anomaly detection model saved in HDF5 format.
- **app.py**: A real-time application showcasing how to use the anomaly detection model.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies required to run the code.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
